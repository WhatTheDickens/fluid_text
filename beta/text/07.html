                              as slow as the pace of oxen. The difference between the ancients and us may
                              be seen in their different treatment of their fellow laborer the ox. We are
                              accustomed to say that the ox is more profitable than the horse, because it
                              not only costs less to keep it, but when it is past labor we can slaughter
                              it, and it will furnish food for our families—we treat it as a slave rather
                              than as a servant. If other nations, as the Egyptians, have been idolators
                              in this respect, and made animals objects of adoration, we have gone to the
                              other and an equally fatal extreme—for every animal should be approached
                              with a feeling of reverence.—“According to the early laws of Greece, the
                              ploughing ox was held sacred, and was entitled when past service, to range

                              be seen in their different treatment of their fellow laborer the ox. We are
                              accustomed to say that the ox is more profitable than the horse, because it

                              it, and it will furnish food for our families—we treat it as a slave rather
                              than as a servant. If other nations, as the Egyptians, have been idolators
                              in this respect, and made animals objects of adoration, we have gone to the

                              with a feeling of reverence.—“According to the early laws of Greece, the
                              ploughing ox was held sacred, and was entitled when past service, to range
                              the pastures in freedom and repose. It was forbidden, by decrees of
                              Triptolemus, to put to death this faithful ally of the labors of the
                              husbandman, who shared the toils of ploughing &amp; threshing. Whenever
                              therefore an ox was slaughtered, he must first be consecrated or devoted as
                              a sacrifice (ίερειου), by the sprinkling of the
                              sacrificial barley; this was a precaution against the barbarous practice of
                              eating raw flesh (Вονφαγία). A peculiar sacrifice (Δμπόλια) at Athens, at which a slayer of the ox fled,

                                 <ins class="rendition-pencil">merely</ins>. Our thoughts on this subject should be
                                 as slow as the pace of oxen. The difference between the ancients and us may
                                 be seen in their different treatment of their fellow laborer the ox. We are
                                 accustomed to say that the ox is more profitable than the horse, because it
                                 not only costs less to keep it, but when it is past labor we can slaughter
                                 it, and it will furnish food for our families—we treat it as a slave rather
                                 than as a servant. If other nations, as the Egyptians, have been idolators
                                 in this respect, and made animals objects of adoration, we have gone to the
                                 other and an equally fatal extreme—for every animal should be approached
                                 with a feeling of reverence.—“According to the early laws of Greece, the
                                 ploughing ox was held sacred, and was entitled when past service, to range
                                 the pastures in freedom and repose. It was forbidden, by decrees of
                                 Triptolemus, to put to death this faithful ally of the labors of the
                                 husbandman, who shared the toils of ploughing &amp; threshing. Whenever
                                 therefore an ox was slaughtered, he must first be consecrated or devoted as
                                 a sacrifice (ίερειου), by the sprinkling of the
                                 sacrificial barley; this was a precaution against the barbarous practice of
                                 eating raw flesh (Вονφαγία). A peculiar sacrifice (Δμπόλια) at Athens, at which a slayer of the ox fled,
                                 and the guilty axe was thrown into the sea, on the sentence of the Prytanes,
                                 yearly placed before the people a visible type of the first beginnings of
                                 their social institutions." Ancient writers on agriculture speak of such
                                 things as the “dignity of the herd." Varro suggests that the object of the
                                 Argonautic expedition was a ram’s fleece—The golden apples of the Hesperides
                                 were by the ambiguity of language goats and sheep which Hercules imported.
                                 The stars and constellations bear their names. The Aegean sea has its name
                                 from the goat—and famous mountains &amp; straits—as the Bosphorus or
                                 ox-passage. Ovid makes Italy to be from <span class="hi rend-style(underline)">vitulas</span>. The fine or tax (mulcta a mulgendo) anciently paid in kind
                                 refers to this. The oldest coins bore the figures of cattle—Our word
                                 pecuniary is from the Latin pecunia which is from <span class="hi rend-style(underline)">pecus</span> or herd—which was the oldest currency
