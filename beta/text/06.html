                                    would come half a dozen <ins>railroad</ins> men to my house at once—healthy and
                                    sturdy working men, descended from sound bodies of men, and still transmitting
                                    arms &amp; legs &amp; bowels <del>from remote generations to posterity. They
                                       had a rude wisdom and courtesy which I love.</del>

                                       had got a rude wisdom withal and a courtesy which I love thanks to their
                                       dear-bought experience.</ins> I met them so often in the woods—that they
                                    began to look upon me at last as one of their kin. One a handsome younger man a
                                    sailor-like—Greek-like man—says to me to-day—“Sir, I like your notions—I think
                                    I shall live so myself. Only I should like wilder country, where there
                                    <del>is</del>
                                    <ins>was</ins> more game. I have been among the Indians near Apallachicola. I
                                    have lived with them. I like your kind of life. Good-day, I wish you success
                                    and happiness." They came in troops on Sundays in clean shirts, with washed
                                    hands &amp; faces, and fresh twigs in their hands. There appeared in some of
                                    these men even at a distance, a genuine magnanimity equal to Greek or Roman, of
                                    unexplored and uncontaminated descent—The expression of their grimmed &amp;
                                    sunburnt features made me think of Epaminondas of Socrates &amp; Cato. The most
                                    famous philosophers &amp; poets seem in some respects infantile beside the easy
                                    and successful life of natural men. These faces—homely—hard and scarred like
                                    the rocks, but human &amp; wise—embracing Copt, and Mussulman and all tribes
                                    &amp; nations. One is a pacha or Sultan—Selim—or Mustapha or Mahmoud in
                                    disguise. Circumstances and employment may conceal for a season but they do not
                                    essentially alter the finer qualities of our nature. I observe among these men
                                    when I meet them on the road an ineradicable refinement &amp; delicacy—as old
                                    as the sun &amp; moon.—A fineness which is commonly thought to adorn the
                                    drawing rooms only. There is no more real rudeness in laborers &amp; washer
                                    women—than in gentlemen and ladies. Under some ancient wrinkled, almost forlorn
                                    visage of an Indian chieftain slumbers all that was ever writ or spoken of man.

                                    six rods off in the midst of a gang with a bandana handkerchief tied about it.
                                    Such as are to succeed the worthies of history. Their humble occupation which
                                    allows them to take no airs upon themselves seems their least
                                    disadvantage—Civilization seems to make bright only the superficial film of the

                              of our journey." At one o’clock the next day Massassoit "brought two fishes that he

                              repairers to my house at once, healthy &amp; sturdy working men, descended
                              from sound bodies &amp; still transmitting arms and legs and bowels
                              downward. Some of them had got a rude wisdom withal, and a <ins class="rendition-pencil">genuine</ins> courtesy <del>which was sweet</del>
                              thanks to their dear bought experience. One a handsome sailor-like young man
                              I remember who had lived among the Indians near Apollachicola, who said to
                              me “Sir, I like your notions," and went away wishing me “success and
                              happiness." They came in troops on Sunday in clean shirts, with washed hands
                              and faces, and fresh twigs in their hands. I observed in some of these men,

                              <del>greater traits methought I noticed in the shortest intercourse, than

                                    would come half a dozen <ins>railroad</ins> men to my house at once—healthy and
                                    sturdy working men, descended from sound bodies of men, and still transmitting
                                    arms &amp; legs &amp; bowels <del>from remote generations to posterity. They
                                       had a rude wisdom and courtesy which I love.</del>

                                       had got a rude wisdom withal and a courtesy which I love thanks to their
                                       dear-bought experience.</ins> I met them so often in the woods—that they
                                    began to look upon me at last as one of their kin. One a handsome younger man a
                                    sailor-like—Greek-like man—says to me to-day—“Sir, I like your notions—I think
                                    I shall live so myself. Only I should like wilder country, where there
                                    <del>is</del>
                                    <ins>was</ins> more game. I have been among the Indians near Apallachicola. I
                                    have lived with them. I like your kind of life. Good-day, I wish you success
                                    and happiness." They came in troops on Sundays in clean shirts, with washed
                                    hands &amp; faces, and fresh twigs in their hands. There appeared in some of
                                    these men even at a distance, a genuine magnanimity equal to Greek or Roman, of
                                    unexplored and uncontaminated descent—The expression of their grimmed &amp;
                                    sunburnt features made me think of Epaminondas of Socrates &amp; Cato. The most
                                    famous philosophers &amp; poets seem in some respects infantile beside the easy
                                    and successful life of natural men. These faces—homely—hard and scarred like
                                    the rocks, but human &amp; wise—embracing Copt, and Mussulman and all tribes
                                    &amp; nations. One is a pacha or Sultan—Selim—or Mustapha or Mahmoud in
                                    disguise. Circumstances and employment may conceal for a season but they do not
                                    essentially alter the finer qualities of our nature. I observe among these men
                                    when I meet them on the road an ineradicable refinement &amp; delicacy—as old
                                    as the sun &amp; moon.—A fineness which is commonly thought to adorn the
                                    drawing rooms only. There is no more real rudeness in laborers &amp; washer
                                    women—than in gentlemen and ladies. Under some ancient wrinkled, almost forlorn
                                    visage of an Indian chieftain slumbers all that was ever writ or spoken of man.

                                    six rods off in the midst of a gang with a bandana handkerchief tied about it.
                                    Such as are to succeed the worthies of history. Their humble occupation which
                                    allows them to take no airs upon themselves seems their least
                                    disadvantage—Civilization seems to make bright only the superficial film of the

                                       &amp; many times we felt that it was good for us to have come together. We

                                       Those which are hardest to crack contain no meat &amp; wise squirrels do not

                              of our journey." At one o’clock the next day Massassoit "brought two fishes that he

                              repairers to my house at once, healthy &amp; sturdy working men, descended
                              from sound bodies &amp; still transmitting arms and legs and bowels
                              downward. Some of them had got a rude wisdom withal, and a <ins class="rendition-pencil">genuine</ins> courtesy <del>which was sweet</del>
                              thanks to their dear bought experience. One a handsome sailor-like young man
                              I remember who had lived among the Indians near Apollachicola, who said to
                              me “Sir, I like your notions," and went away wishing me “success and
                              happiness." They came in troops on Sunday in clean shirts, with washed hands
                              and faces, and fresh twigs in their hands. I observed in some of these men,

                              <del>greater traits methought I noticed in the shortest intercourse, than

               <br>[The following passage precedes Visitors 2.] Sometimes there
               would come half a dozen <ins>railroad</ins> men to my house at once—healthy and
               sturdy working men, descended from sound bodies of men, and still transmitting
               arms &amp; legs &amp; bowels <del>from remote generations to posterity. They
                  had a rude wisdom and courtesy which I love.</del>
               <ins class="rendition-pencil">downward from remote days to more remote. Some of them
                  had got a rude wisdom withal and a courtesy which I love thanks to their
                  dear-bought experience.</ins> I met them so often in the woods—that they
               began to look upon me at last as one of their kin. One a handsome younger man a
               sailor-like—Greek-like man—says to me to-day—“Sir, I like your notions—I think
               I shall live so myself. Only I should like wilder country, where there
               <del>is</del>
               <ins>was</ins> more game. I have been among the Indians near Apallachicola. I
               have lived with them. I like your kind of life. Good-day, I wish you success
               and happiness." They came in troops on Sundays in clean shirts, with washed
               hands &amp; faces, and fresh twigs in their hands. There appeared in some of
               these men even at a distance, a genuine magnanimity equal to Greek or Roman, of
               unexplored and uncontaminated descent—The expression of their grimmed &amp;
               sunburnt features made me think of Epaminondas of Socrates &amp; Cato. The most
               famous philosophers &amp; poets seem in some respects infantile beside the easy
               and successful life of natural men. These faces—homely—hard and scarred like
               the rocks, but human &amp; wise—embracing Copt, and Mussulman and all tribes
               &amp; nations. One is a pacha or Sultan—Selim—or Mustapha or Mahmoud in
               disguise. Circumstances and employment may conceal for a season but they do not
               essentially alter the finer qualities of our nature. I observe among these men
               when I meet them on the road an ineradicable refinement &amp; delicacy—as old
               as the sun &amp; moon.—A fineness which is commonly thought to adorn the
               drawing rooms only. There is no more real rudeness in laborers &amp; washer
               women—than in gentlemen and ladies. Under some ancient wrinkled, almost forlorn
               visage of an Indian chieftain slumbers all that was ever writ or spoken of man.
               You can tell a nobleman’s head though he may be shovelling gravel beneath it
               six rods off in the midst of a gang with a bandana handkerchief tied about it.
               Such as are to succeed the worthies of history. Their humble occupation which
               allows them to take no airs upon themselves seems their least
               disadvantage—Civilization seems to make bright only the superficial film of the
               eye. Most men are wrecked upon their consciousness. 
               <br>(preceded by two leaves, #99-101, from A that were taken into B
               and renumbered, #117-119) men, descended from sound bodies, and still
               transmitting arms and legs and bowels downward <del>from remote days to more
                  remote</del>. Some of them had got a rude wisdom withal and a courtesy which
               I love, thanks to their dear-bought experience. <del>I met them so often in the

               the Indians near Apallachicola. I have lived with them. I like your kind of
               life. Good-day. I wish you success and happiness." They came in troops on
