                              I beheld the
                              phenomenon,” says he, “there appeared, (strange to relate!) a resplendent light over

                              displayed itself conspicuously to all that I have thought proper to show it to, but
                              those were very few.
                              This shining light is to be seen in the morning over my shadow till two o’clock in
                              the afternoon, and it
                              appears to the greatest advantage when the grass is moist with dew; it is likewise
                              visible in the
                              evening at sunset. This phenomenon I took notice of when I was at Paris, because
                              the air is exceedingly clear in that climate, so that I could distinguish it there
                              much plainer than in
                              Italy, where mists are much more frequent; but I can still see it even here,
                              and show it to others, though not to the same advantage as in France.” </span>

                           <span class="reading Princeton_Ed"> I thought of living there before I went to Walden. I “hooked” the apples, leaped
                              the brook, and scared
                              the musquash and the trout. It was one of those afternoons which seem indefinitely
                              long before one, in which
                              many events may happen, a large portion of our natural life, though it was already
                              half spent when I started.
                              By the way there came up a shower, which compelled me to stand half an hour under
                              a pine, piling boughs over
                              my head, and wearing my handkerchief for a shed; and when at length I had made one
                              cast over the
                              pickerel-weed, standing up to my middle in water, I found myself suddenly in the shadow
                              of a cloud, and the
                              thunder began to rumble with such emphasis that I could do no more than listen to
                              it. The gods must be proud,
                              thought I, with such forked flashes to rout a poor unarmed fisherman. So I made haste
                              for shelter to the
                              nearest hut, which stood half a mile from any road, but so much the nearer to the
                              pond, and had long been
                              uninhabited: — </span>

                           <span class="reading Princeton_Ed"> So the Muse fables. But therein, as I found, dwelt now John Field, an Irishman, and
                              his wife, and
                              several children, from the broad-faced boy who assisted his father at his work, and
                              now came running by his
                              side from the bog to escape the rain, to the wrinkled, sibyl-like, cone-headed infant
                              that sat upon its
                              father’s knee as in the palaces of nobles, and looked out from its home in the midst
                              of wet and hunger
                              inquisitively upon the stranger, with the privilege of infancy, not knowing but it
                              was the last of a noble
                              line, and the hope and cynosure of the world, instead of John Field’s poor starveling
                              brat. There we sat
                              together under that part of the roof which leaked the least, while it showered and
                              thundered without. I had
                              sat there many times of old before the ship was built that floated his family to America.
                              An honest,
                              hard-working, but shiftless man plainly was John Field; and his wife, she too was
                              brave to cook so many
                              successive dinners in the recesses of that lofty stove; with round greasy face and
                              bare breast, still thinking
                              to improve her condition one day; with the never absent mop in one hand, and yet no
                              effects of it visible any
                              where. The chickens, which had also taken shelter here from the rain, stalked about
                              the room like members of
                              the family, too humanized methought to roast well. They stood and looked in my eye
                              or pecked at my shoe
                              significantly. Meanwhile my host told me his story, how hard he worked “bogging” for
                              a neighboring farmer,
                              turning up a meadow with a spade or bog hoe at the rate of ten dollars an acre and
                              the use of the land with
                              manure for one year, and his little broad-faced son worked cheerfully at his father’s
                              side the while, not
                              knowing how poor a bargain the latter had made. I tried to help him with my experience,
                              telling him that he
                              was one of my nearest neighbors, and that I too, who came a-fishing here, and looked
                              like a loafer, was
                              getting my living like himself; that I lived in a tight, light, and clean house, which
                              hardly cost more than
                              the annual rent of such a ruin as his commonly amounts to; and how, if he chose, he
                              might in a month or two
                              build himself a palace of his own; that I did not use tea, nor coffee, nor butter,
                              nor milk, nor fresh meat,
                              and so did not have to work to get them; again, as I did not work hard, I did not
                              have to eat hard, and it
                              cost me but a trifle for my food; but as he began with tea, and coffee, and butter,
                              and milk, and beef, he had
                              to work hard to pay for them, and when he had worked hard he had to eat hard again
                              to repair the waste of his
                              system, — and so it was as broad as it was long, indeed it was broader than it was
                              long, for he was
                              discontented and wasted his life into the bargain; and yet he had rated it as a gain
                              in coming to America,
                              that here you could get tea, and coffee, and meat every day. But the only true America
                              is that country where
                              you are at liberty to pursue such a mode of life as may enable you to do without these,
                              and where the state
                              does not endeavor to compel you to sustain the slavery and war and other superfluous
                              expenses which directly
                              or indirectly result from the use of such things. For I purposely talked to him as
                              if he were a philosopher,
                              or desired to be one. I should be glad if all the meadows on the earth were left in
                              a wild state, if that were
                              the consequence of men’s beginning to redeem themselves. A man will not need to study
                              history to find out what
                              is best for his own culture. But alas! the culture of an Irishman is an enterprise
                              to be undertaken with a
                              sort of moral bog hoe. I told him, that as he worked so hard at bogging, he required
                              thick boots and stout
                              clothing, which yet were soon soiled and worn out, but I wore light shoes and thin
                              clothing, which cost not
                              half so much, though he might think that I was dressed like a gentleman (which, however,
                              was not the case,)
                              and in an hour or two, without labor, but as a recreation, I could, if I wished, catch
                              as many fish as I
                              should want for two days, or earn enough money to support me a week. If he and his
                              family would live simply,
                              they might all go a-huckleberrying in the summer for their amusement. John heaved
                              a sigh at this, and his wife
                              stared with arms a-kimbo, and both appeared to be wondering if they had capital enough
                              to begin such a course
                              with, or arithmetic enough to carry it through. It was sailing by dead reckoning to
                              them, and they saw not
                              clearly how to make their port so; therefore I suppose they still take life bravely,
                              after their fashion, face
                              to face, giving it tooth and nail, not having skill to split its massive columns with
                              any fine entering wedge,
                              and rout it in detail;—thinking to deal with it roughly, as one should handle a thistle.
                              But they fight at an
                              overwhelming disadvantage,—living, John Field, alas! without arithmetic, and failing
                              so. </span>

                                 savage places
                                 seemed for an instant trivial to me who had been sent to school &amp; college but</ins> as I ran
                              down the hill to the pond—with the rain-bow over my shoulder—and some slight tinkling
                              sounds borne to my
                              ear through the cleansed air—from I know not what quarter <ins>my Genius said—grow wild according to thy
                                 nature like these ferns &amp; brakes which endeavor not to become English hay. Let the

                                 thee. Take shelter under the cloud while they flee to carts &amp; sheds</ins> &amp; I said to
                              myself—Why not live always a rude and frontier life—full of adventures and hard work—learn
                              much—travel
                              much—though it be only through these woods &amp; fields! There is no other country than
                              this—here is
                              the field and the man.—The daily boundaries of life are expanded &amp; dispersed and I
                              see in what
                              field I stand. Roam far and wide—grasp at life and conquer it. Learn much and live.

                              free—stay till late in the night—be unwise and daring. See many men far &amp; near in

                                 ear through the cleansed air—from I know not what quarter <ins>my Genius said—grow wild according to thy
                                    nature like these ferns &amp; brakes which endeavor not to become English hay. Let the
                                    thunder
                                    rumble in thy own tongue—what if it brings ruin to farmers’ crops in season that is
                                    not its errand to
                                    thee. Take shelter under the cloud while they flee to carts &amp; sheds</ins> &amp; I said to
                                 myself—Why not live always a rude and frontier life—full of adventures and hard work—learn
                                 much—travel
                                 much—though it be only through these woods &amp; fields! There is no other country than
                                 this—here is
                                 the field and the man.—The daily boundaries of life are expanded &amp; dispersed and I
                                 see in what
                                 field I stand. Roam far and wide—grasp at life and conquer it. Learn much and live.
                                 You are really
                                 free—stay till late in the night—be unwise and daring. See many men far &amp; near in
                                 their fields
                                 &amp; cottages before the sun sets—though as if many more were to be seen—Rest not every
                                 night in
                                 villages nor in the same place. The noblest life is continuous and unintermitting
                                 without pauses or
                                 waste.</span></span>
                           
                           
                           <span class="reading Princeton_Ed">As I was leaving the Irishman’s roof after the rain, bending my steps again to the
                              pond,
                              my haste to catch pickerel, wading in retired meadows, in sloughs and bog-holes, in
                              forlorn and savage
                              places, appeared for an instant trivial to me who had been sent to school and college;
                              but as I ran down
                              the hill toward the reddening west, with the rainbow over my shoulder, and some faint
                              tinkling sounds
                              borne to my ear through the cleansed air, from I know not what quarter, my Good Genius
                              seemed to say,—Go
                              fish and hunt far and wide day by day,—farther and wider,—and rest thee by many brooks
                              and hearth-sides
                              without misgiving. Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth. Rise free from care
                              before the dawn, and
                              seek adventures. Let the noon find thee by other lakes, and the night overtake thee
                              every where at home.
                              There are no larger fields than these, no worthier games than may here be played.
                              Grow wild according to
                              thy nature, like these sedges and brakes, which will never become English hay. Let
                              the thunder rumble;
                              what if it threaten ruin to farmers’ crops? that is not its errand to thee. Take shelter
                              under the cloud,
                              while they flee to carts and sheds. Let not to get a living be thy trade, but thy
                              sport. Enjoy the land,
                              but own it not. Through want of enterprise and faith men are where they are, buying
                              and selling, and
                              spending their lives like serfs.</span>

                              were communicated to him which afterward came to pass. “From the very moment that
                              I beheld the
                              phenomenon,” says he, “there appeared, (strange to relate!) a resplendent light over
                              my head, which has
                              displayed itself conspicuously to all that I have thought proper to show it to, but
                              those were very few.
                              This shining light is to be seen in the morning over my shadow till two o’clock in
                              the afternoon, and it
                              appears to the greatest advantage when the grass is moist with dew; it is likewise
                              visible in the
                              evening at sunset. This phenomenon I took notice of when I was at Paris, because
                              the air is exceedingly clear in that climate, so that I could distinguish it there
                              much plainer than in
                              Italy, where mists are much more frequent; but I can still see it even here,
                              and show it to others, though not to the same advantage as in France.” </span>

                           <span class="reading Princeton_Ed"> I thought of living there before I went to Walden. I “hooked” the apples, leaped
                              the brook, and scared
                              the musquash and the trout. It was one of those afternoons which seem indefinitely
                              long before one, in which
                              many events may happen, a large portion of our natural life, though it was already
                              half spent when I started.
                              By the way there came up a shower, which compelled me to stand half an hour under
                              a pine, piling boughs over
                              my head, and wearing my handkerchief for a shed; and when at length I had made one
                              cast over the
                              pickerel-weed, standing up to my middle in water, I found myself suddenly in the shadow
                              of a cloud, and the
                              thunder began to rumble with such emphasis that I could do no more than listen to
                              it. The gods must be proud,
                              thought I, with such forked flashes to rout a poor unarmed fisherman. So I made haste
                              for shelter to the
                              nearest hut, which stood half a mile from any road, but so much the nearer to the
                              pond, and had long been

                              several children, from the broad-faced boy who assisted his father at his work, and
                              now came running by his
                              side from the bog to escape the rain, to the wrinkled, sibyl-like, cone-headed infant
                              that sat upon its
                              father’s knee as in the palaces of nobles, and looked out from its home in the midst
                              of wet and hunger
                              inquisitively upon the stranger, with the privilege of infancy, not knowing but it
                              was the last of a noble
                              line, and the hope and cynosure of the world, instead of John Field’s poor starveling
                              brat. There we sat
                              together under that part of the roof which leaked the least, while it showered and
                              thundered without. I had
                              sat there many times of old before the ship was built that floated his family to America.
                              An honest,
                              hard-working, but shiftless man plainly was John Field; and his wife, she too was
                              brave to cook so many
                              successive dinners in the recesses of that lofty stove; with round greasy face and
                              bare breast, still thinking
                              to improve her condition one day; with the never absent mop in one hand, and yet no
                              effects of it visible any
                              where. The chickens, which had also taken shelter here from the rain, stalked about
                              the room like members of
                              the family, too humanized methought to roast well. They stood and looked in my eye
                              or pecked at my shoe
                              significantly. Meanwhile my host told me his story, how hard he worked “bogging” for
                              a neighboring farmer,
                              turning up a meadow with a spade or bog hoe at the rate of ten dollars an acre and
                              the use of the land with
                              manure for one year, and his little broad-faced son worked cheerfully at his father’s
                              side the while, not
                              knowing how poor a bargain the latter had made. I tried to help him with my experience,
                              telling him that he
                              was one of my nearest neighbors, and that I too, who came a-fishing here, and looked
                              like a loafer, was
                              getting my living like himself; that I lived in a tight, light, and clean house, which
                              hardly cost more than
                              the annual rent of such a ruin as his commonly amounts to; and how, if he chose, he
                              might in a month or two
                              build himself a palace of his own; that I did not use tea, nor coffee, nor butter,
                              nor milk, nor fresh meat,
                              and so did not have to work to get them; again, as I did not work hard, I did not
                              have to eat hard, and it
                              cost me but a trifle for my food; but as he began with tea, and coffee, and butter,
                              and milk, and beef, he had
                              to work hard to pay for them, and when he had worked hard he had to eat hard again
                              to repair the waste of his
                              system, — and so it was as broad as it was long, indeed it was broader than it was
                              long, for he was
                              discontented and wasted his life into the bargain; and yet he had rated it as a gain
                              in coming to America,
                              that here you could get tea, and coffee, and meat every day. But the only true America
                              is that country where
                              you are at liberty to pursue such a mode of life as may enable you to do without these,
                              and where the state
                              does not endeavor to compel you to sustain the slavery and war and other superfluous
                              expenses which directly
                              or indirectly result from the use of such things. For I purposely talked to him as
                              if he were a philosopher,
                              or desired to be one. I should be glad if all the meadows on the earth were left in
                              a wild state, if that were
                              the consequence of men’s beginning to redeem themselves. A man will not need to study
                              history to find out what
                              is best for his own culture. But alas! the culture of an Irishman is an enterprise
                              to be undertaken with a
                              sort of moral bog hoe. I told him, that as he worked so hard at bogging, he required
                              thick boots and stout
                              clothing, which yet were soon soiled and worn out, but I wore light shoes and thin
                              clothing, which cost not
                              half so much, though he might think that I was dressed like a gentleman (which, however,
                              was not the case,)
                              and in an hour or two, without labor, but as a recreation, I could, if I wished, catch
                              as many fish as I
                              should want for two days, or earn enough money to support me a week. If he and his
                              family would live simply,
                              they might all go a-huckleberrying in the summer for their amusement. John heaved
                              a sigh at this, and his wife
                              stared with arms a-kimbo, and both appeared to be wondering if they had capital enough
                              to begin such a course
                              with, or arithmetic enough to carry it through. It was sailing by dead reckoning to
                              them, and they saw not
                              clearly how to make their port so; therefore I suppose they still take life bravely,
                              after their fashion, face
                              to face, giving it tooth and nail, not having skill to split its massive columns with
                              any fine entering wedge,
                              and rout it in detail;—thinking to deal with it roughly, as one should handle a thistle.
                              But they fight at an
                              overwhelming disadvantage,—living, John Field, alas! without arithmetic, and failing
                              so. </span>

                           <span class="reading Princeton_Ed">As I was leaving the Irishman’s roof after the rain, bending my steps again to the
                              pond,
                              my haste to catch pickerel, wading in retired meadows, in sloughs and bog-holes, in
                              forlorn and savage
                              places, appeared for an instant trivial to me who had been sent to school and college;
                              but as I ran down
                              the hill toward the reddening west, with the rainbow over my shoulder, and some faint
                              tinkling sounds
                              borne to my ear through the cleansed air, from I know not what quarter, my Good Genius
                              seemed to say,—Go
                              fish and hunt far and wide day by day,—farther and wider,—and rest thee by many brooks
                              and hearth-sides
                              without misgiving. Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth. Rise free from care
                              before the dawn, and
                              seek adventures. Let the noon find thee by other lakes, and the night overtake thee
                              every where at home.
                              There are no larger fields than these, no worthier games than may here be played.
                              Grow wild according to
                              thy nature, like these sedges and brakes, which will never become English hay. Let
                              the thunder rumble;
                              what if it threaten ruin to farmers’ crops? that is not its errand to thee. Take shelter
                              under the cloud,
                              while they flee to carts and sheds. Let not to get a living be thy trade, but thy
                              sport. Enjoy the land,
                              but own it not. Through want of enterprise and faith men are where they are, buying
                              and selling, and
                              spending their lives like serfs.</span>
