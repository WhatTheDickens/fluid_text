                                    and primitive hall, a crystallization around me, and reminded <ins class="rendition-pencil">me</ins> of

                                    in the
                                    blue-berry and raspberry region, which had this <ins class="rendition-pencil">auroral &amp;</ins>
                                    ambrosial character. He was the miller of the Kanterskill Falls, &amp; his family were

                                    &amp; wholesome people like the house. The latter was not plastered but only lathed, and

                                    inner doors were not hung. It was high-placed, airy, &amp; perfumed; so high that only

                              Men esteem truth remote, in the outskirts of the system, behind the farthest star,
                              before Adam and
                              after the last man. In eternity there is indeed something true and sublime. But all

                              more divine in the lapse of all the ages. And we are enabled to apprehend at all what

                              us. The universe

                                    and primitive hall, a crystallization around me, and reminded <ins class="rendition-pencil">me</ins> of

                                    in the
                                    blue-berry and raspberry region, which had this <ins class="rendition-pencil">auroral &amp;</ins>
                                    ambrosial character. He was the miller of the Kanterskill Falls, &amp; his family were

                                    &amp; wholesome people like the house. The latter was not plastered but only lathed, and

                                    inner doors were not hung. It was high-placed, airy, &amp; perfumed; so high that only

                              Men esteem truth remote, in the outskirts of the system, behind the farthest star,
                              before Adam and
                              after the last man. In eternity there is indeed something true and sublime. But all

                              more divine in the lapse of all the ages. And we are enabled to apprehend at all what

                              us. The universe

               “Economy” are numbered from 1 to 129 in the upper right hand corner of the recto of
               each odd-numbered
               leaf. Several unnumbered leaves were deleted before the pages were numbered. A few
               leaves from A were
               not recopied but inserted among the leaves of B-C and renumbered to fit the new sequence.
               A few leaves
               from the early stages of D were also numbered to fit this sequence.

               <br>Where I Lived, and What I Lived For 8c appears as

               rudimental, airy
               and primitive hall, a crystallization around me, and reminded <ins class="rendition-pencil">me</ins> of
               some mountain houses I had seen, which had this fresh auroral atmosphere <del>about them</del>
               <ins class="rendition-pencil">smile not ye that have seen my abode</ins>. I had lodged in the house of a
               sawmiller on the Kanterskill mountains the previous summer, high up as the Pine Orchard,
               in the
               blue-berry and raspberry region, which had this <ins class="rendition-pencil">auroral &amp;</ins>
               ambrosial character. He was the miller of the Kanterskill Falls, &amp; his family were
               clean
               &amp; wholesome people like the house. The latter was not plastered but only lathed, and
               the
               inner doors were not hung. It was high-placed, airy, &amp; perfumed; so high that only
               the
               winds that swept over the ridge of the Kanterskills <ins class="rendition-pencil">bearing only the broken
                  strains and warps and accompaniments of celestial parts of terrestrial music</ins> passed
               through it. <del>—The very light &amp; atmosphere in which the most enduring works of art are
                  composed.—On the tops of mountains, as everywhere to hopeful souls, it is always
                  morning.</del>—A <del>clean and</del> pure <ins>temple of a</ins> house which one would enter as
               naturally and gratefully as he would go under <del>a shade, which might fitly</del>
               <ins>the shade of a tree, fit to</ins> adorn a mountain’s brow—and entertain a travelling god, and
               where a goddess might trail her garment.—Such it seemed to me all our houses should
               be.
               <br>Where I Lived, and What I Lived For 8c appears as
               follows. It had altogether an auroral and ambrosial character in my eyes, as if the
               winds that
               passed through it were such only as sweep over the ridges of mountains—bearing the
               broken strains
               and warps or celestial parts <ins class="rendition-pencil">only</ins> of terrestrial music—fit to
               entertain a travelling god, and where a goddess might trail her garment.

               <br>Where I Lived, and What I Lived For 9, which follows
               8a, appears as follows. From our village houses to this lodge on the shore of <del>a beautiful

               <ins>so fair a lake</ins> in the midst of <del>a green</del>

               <ins>swung</ins> in a pleasant grove, where I could glimpse the light &amp; the flowers through

               as
               freely as it wandered amid the boughs and needles of the pines around, and I imbibed
               the influences of
               nature with as little alloy as a bird in its nest amid foliage. <del>It was invigorating only to sit
                  there and drink and be bathed in this uncontaminated current.</del> The atmosphere of our houses
               has usually lost some of its life giving principle and it is necessary to our health
               and spirits
               frequently to go out, as we say, to take the air.
