                                 I might say that
                                 the student always studies antiques. In our studies we do not look forward but backward
                                 into antiquity
                                 with redoubled pauses. Where is that lost first page of history? We have never found
                                 the literature that
                                 dated from antiquity sufficiently remote. The most adventurous student seeks the remotest
                                 antiquity—the
                                 history of a time, as it were, prior to time,—Or, if we prefer, such is the Protean

                                 we may say that he always interprets prophecies and oracles, and is interested solely
                                 in the

                           <span class="reading Version_D">The best books are not read even by those who are called good readers. What does our
                              Concord culture amount to? There is in this town, with a very few exceptions, no taste
                              for the best or
                              for very good books even in English literature, whose words all can read and spell.
                              Even the
                              college-bred and so called liberally educated men here and elsewhere have really little
                              or no
                              acquaintance with the English classics; and as for the recorded wisdom of mankind,
                              the ancient classics
                              and Bibles, which are accessible to all who will know of them, there are the feeblest
                              efforts any where
                              made to become acquainted with them. I know a woodchopper, of middle age, who takes a French paper, not for news
                              as he says, for he is above that, but to “keep himself in practice,” he being a Canadian
                              by birth; and
                              when I ask him what he considers the best thing he can do in this world, he says,
                              beside this, to keep
                              up and add to his English. This is about as much as the college bred generally do
                              or aspire to do, and

                              up and add to his English. This is about as much as the college bred generally do
                              or aspire to do, and
                              they take an English paper for the purpose. One who has just come from reading perhaps
                              one of the best
                              English books will find how many with whom he can converse about it? Or suppose he
                              comes from reading a
                              Greek or Latin classic in the original, whose praises are familiar even to the so
                              called illiterate; he
                              will find nobody at all to speak to, but must keep silence about it. Indeed, there
                              is hardly the
                              professor in our colleges, who, if he has mastered the difficulties of the language,
                              has proportionally
                              mastered the difficulties of the wit and poetry of a Greek poet, and has any sympathy
                              to impart to the
                              alert and heroic reader; and as for the sacred Scriptures, or Bibles of mankind, who
                              in this town can
                              tell me even their titles? Most men do not know that any nation but the Hebrews have
                              had a scripture. A
                              man, any man, will go considerably out of his way to pick up a silver dollar; but
                              here are golden words,
                              which the wisest men of antiquity have uttered, and whose worth the wise of every
                              succeeding age have
